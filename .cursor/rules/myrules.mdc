Whenever you receive a request or task:
1. Analyze the problem or task presented to you.
2. Explain the core issue and propose a clear solution plan.
3. **Wait for my explicit command or confirmation** before proceeding with any actual code implementation or file changes.
4. Only if I issue the command "proceed" or "execute", begin the implementation of the plan.
5. **Always write clean, well-structured, optimized code at a Senior Developer level, adhering to best practices and idiomatic conventions.**
